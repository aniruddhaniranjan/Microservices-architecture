PATTERN 1: STRANGLER APPLICATION
Problem - How do you migrate a legacy monolithic application to a microservice architecture?
Solution - Incrementally developing a new (strangler) application around the legacy application. In this scenario, the strangler application has a microservice architecture. Strangler application consists of sevaral smaller microservices - which could implement functionality that resided in the legacy application or new functionality. Also, the monolith decreases in size over time.

PATTERN 2: ANTI-CORRUPTION LAYER
