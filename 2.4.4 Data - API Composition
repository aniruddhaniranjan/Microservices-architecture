Problem - How to implement queries and joins in a microservice architecture?
Solution - Implement a query by defining an API Composer, which invokes the services that own the data and performs an in-memory join of the results (An API Gateway often does API composition.)
Benefits:
It a simple way to query data in a microservice architecture
Drawbacks:
Some queries would result in inefficient, in-memory joins of large datasets
