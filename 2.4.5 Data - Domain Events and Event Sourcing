DOMAIN EVENTS
Problem: How does a service publish an event when it updates its data? Events might be needed to update a view in CQRS, or to be consumed by another service in choreography-based saga
Solution: Organize the business logic of a service as a collection of DDD aggregates that emit domain events when they created or updated. The service publishes these domain events so that they can be consumed by other services.
What are aggregates?
A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An example may be an order and its line-items. An aggregate will have one of its component objects be the aggregate root. Any references from outside the aggregate should only go to the aggregate root. The root can thus ensure the integrity of the aggregate as a whole. Aggregates are the basic element of transfer of data storage - you request to load or save whole aggregates. Transactions should not cross aggregate boundaries. (An aggregate will often contain mutliple collections, together with simple fields).
